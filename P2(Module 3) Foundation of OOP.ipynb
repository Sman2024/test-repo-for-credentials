    "1. A stack is an object designed to store data using the LIFO model. The stack usually performs at least two operations, named push() and pop().\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implementing the stack in a procedural model raises several problems which can be solved by the techniques offered by OOP (Object Oriented Programming):\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A class method is actually a function declared inside the class and able to access all the class's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The part of the Python class responsible for creating new objects is called the constructor, and it's implemented as a method of the name __init__.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Each class method declaration must contain at least one parameter (always the first one) usually referred to as self, and is used by the objects to identify themselves.\n",
