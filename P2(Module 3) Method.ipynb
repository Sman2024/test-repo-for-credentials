    "\n",
    "As you already know, a method is a function embedded inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one fundamental requirement - a method is obliged to have at least one parameter (there are no such thing as parameterless methods - a method may be invoked without an argument, but not declared without parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first (or only) parameter is usually named self. We suggest that you follow the convention - it's commonly used, and you'll cause a few surprises by using other names for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name self suggests the parameter's purpose - it identifies the object for which the method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to invoke a method, you mustn't pass the argument for the self parameter - Python will set it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example in the editor shows the difference."

    "Don't forget that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a single inheritance class is always simpler, safer, and easier to understand and maintain;\n",
    "\n",
    "    multiple inheritance is always risky, as you have many more opportunities to make a mistake in identifying these parts of the superclasses which will effectively influence the new class;\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    multiple inheritance violates the single responsibility principle (more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) as it makes a new class of two (or more) classes that know nothing about each other;\n",

    "MRO, in general, is a way (you can call it a strategy) in which a particular programming language scans through the upper part of a class’s hierarchy in order to find the method it currently needs. It's worth emphasizing that different languages use slightly (or even completely) different MROs. Python is a unique creature in this respect, however, and its customs are a bit specific.\n",
    "\n",

Let's start with a snippet that initially may look simple. Look at what we've prepared for you in the editor.\n",
